## Description

This scala code gives a simple way to read a file and count the word occurance of it. In here I used only for .txt but you can try .docx files also.
This is the way tried with minimum code lines and simple way.
Addicianlly i used Scalatest (`scalatest`) you can find the this dependancy from maven central repository. In advanced I share the dependancy I used , here it is :
`libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.0-SNAP4" % Test`

**Happy Coding
